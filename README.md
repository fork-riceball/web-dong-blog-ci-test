## Configure

- Edit the config file `src/site.config.ts` for basic site meta data
- Update file `globalConfig.ts` site property with your own domain
- Create / edit posts for your blog within `src/content/post/` with .md/mdx file(s). See [below](#adding-posts) for more details.

## Adding posts

This theme utilises [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to organise Markdown and/or MDX files, as well as type-checking frontmatter with a schema -> `src/content/config.ts`.

Adding a post is a simple as adding your .md(x) file(s) to the `src/content/post` folder, the filename of which will be used as the slug/url. The two posts included with this template are there as an example of how to structure your frontmatter. Additionally, the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/) has a detailed section on markdown pages.

### Frontmatter

TODO... Please Check `src/content/config.ts` for more information

## Deploy

[Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) has a great section and breakdown of how to deploy your own Astro site on various platforms and their idiosyncrasies.

By default the site will be built (see [Commands](#commands) section above) to a `/dist` directory.
